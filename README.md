# Automated-Detection-of-Aesthetic-Defects-in-EV-Battery-Welds-Using-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on improving the quality inspection of welds in EV batteries by automating defect detection using machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Traditional manual inspection is slow and error-prone, so the proposed model analyzes 2D images to classify welds as defective or non-defective. Preprocessing techniques like normalization and image augmentation enhance the model’s performance. The system demonstrates high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, making it a reliable solution for real-time quality assurance. Future work aims to integrate it into production lines and refine its capabilities for defect localization and classification.

The proposed system aims to overcome the limitations of manual and traditional non-destructive testing methods by implementing an automated defect detection framework using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This system leverages advancements in deep learning and computer vision to ensure reliable, accurate, and scalable inspection processes for welds in EV batteries.
