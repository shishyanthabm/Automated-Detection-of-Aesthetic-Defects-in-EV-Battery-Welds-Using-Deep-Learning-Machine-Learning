# Automated-Detection-of-Aesthetic-Defects-in-EV-Battery-Welds-Using-Deep-Learning-Machine-Learning
This project focuses on improving the quality inspection of welds in EV batteries by automating defect detection using machine learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Traditional manual inspection is slow and error-prone, so the proposed model analyzes 2D images to classify welds as defective or non-defective. Preprocessing techniques like normalization and image augmentation enhance the modelâ€™s performance. The system demonstrates high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores, making it a reliable solution for real-time quality assurance. Future work aims to integrate it into production lines and refine its capabilities for defect localization and classification.
